# 👋 Hi, I’m @saurabhappdev

Welcome to my GitHub profile! This repository is for my micro projects where I explore smaller concepts in depth. While I focus on Native Android development with Java and Kotlin, I am also diving into topics like Android NDK, performance optimization, and architecture patterns.

## About Me
I am a **Native Android Developer** proficient in **Java** and **Kotlin**. I love exploring current topics and working on optimizing existing code. Currently, I am diving into **Jetpack Compose** with plans to eventually transition into **Compose Multiplatform**. I'm also learning **Figma** for UI/UX design, aiming to become a **one-man army** capable of handling both development and design.

Right now, I am working on an **MVVM architecture** with **Repository design** in my pipeline. I plan to post this and other projects here to showcase my learning journey and contributions.

## 👀 I’m interested in
- Android Development (Java, Kotlin)
- Jetpack Compose & Compose Multiplatform
- Android NDK & Performance Optimization
- UI/UX Design with Figma
